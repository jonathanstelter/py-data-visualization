# py-data-visualization
This repository is a short game demonstrating different python data visualization packages (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, bokeh, altair).
It is optimized to be used with Google Colab.

A sample solution is provided in '/solution' (DO NOT OPEN AT THE BEGINNING!). The game can be easily solved by searching the documentation for each of the packages.

## How to get started 
You need a Google account for using Google Colab with the provided data.
- Accessing the notebook without local installation: Go to https://colab.research.google.com/github/jonathanstelter/py-data-visualization/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python.ipynb 
- Getting the data: Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gPH01t3Wcm9Ka2Gaf24dWsyLemGziZSN?usp=sharing and add this folder (temporarily) to your Google Drive.
- Mounting your Google Drive in Google Colab: Execute the first cell. Maybe it takes a while to install the latest version of plotly. If the folder *py_data_visualization* is not in your root directory, you need to adapt the variable *dir_location*.
- Now you are ready to start. Have fun!
